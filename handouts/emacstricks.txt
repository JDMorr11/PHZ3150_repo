This is a file of useful things you can do in emacs:



1. Run commands more than once:
Esc- <number of times to run command> <command or keystroke>

Run something four times, or define an argument for it (depends on the
command):
C-u <command or keystroke>
To run something 16, 64, 256, ... times, type C-u more than once.



2. Keyboard macros.  These are sequences of editing commands you can
do at will.  They are useful for rearranging tables or processing data
files from one format into another.  For example, if you have a file
of postal-form addresses and you want to make a list with columns for
name, street address, city, state, and postal code, you could easily
define a keyboard macro and then execute it hundreds of times with a
few keystrokes.

Type:
C-x (
to start defining a keyboard macro.

Type the editing commands.  Do not use the mouse.  If it's a macro you
might execute more than once, be sure to leave your cursor in the
right place for that.

Type:
C-x )
to finish defining the keyboard macro.

Type:
C-x e
to execute the macro.  If you want to execute it again right away,
just type:
e

If you are making a keyboard macro and make a mistake you can't
correct, type:
C-g
to "ring the bell" and stop defining the macro.

To name the macro, type:
M-x name-last-keyboard-macro

This lets you run it with:
M-x <name of macro>

This is more cumbersome than C-x e, but it lets you define more than
one macro.  There is a great deal more possible with keyboard macros.
