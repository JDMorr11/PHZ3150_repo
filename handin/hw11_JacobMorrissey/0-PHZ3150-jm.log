downloaded HW4 file into homework folder
created hw4_jacobmorrissey folder in handin folder
opened new jupyter notebook hw4_jacobmorrissey.ipynb
began problem 2
tried to use a for loop to calculate F from lists of m and a values
      for i in m:
      	  F = m[i] * a[i]
	  print(F)
got an error because i is equal to the element in the list and not its index
searched for a guide on for loops and found a different method
      for i in range(len(m)):
      	  F = m[i] * a[i]
	  print(F)
this method worked
used the same structure to define a function force_to_acceleration
     Caclulates acceleration a [m / s^2] of a 150 kg body from the applied force F [kg m / s^2].
began problem 3
wrote all four variables from the hw file as lists
created a file for the acceleration function: accleration_hw4.py
imported the function in my hw4 notebook
used the same for loop structure again to calculate a

changed the file names of the screenshots taken for hw2
each file name now starts with hw2_JaMor_prob#_ followed by the application name
previously these file names didn't include the hhw number, my name, or problem number
copied my hw4 notebook and acceleration function into my handin folder
changes to the handin folder weren't being tracked
couldn't get any changes to track so i made a new repository
moved my entire class folder into PHZ3150_repo
made a new hw4_jacobmorrissey folder and added my jupyter files
committed the changes and pushed
will save my log and add to hw4_jacobmorrissey then zip and submit to webcourses

HW5
Problem 1
made folder hw5_jacobmorrissey in handin folder
opened jupyter notebook
created new notebook called hw5_jacobmorrissey
Problem 2
made lists using list(range(0,100,10)) and 1000,100
assumed the 3rd element refers to velocity[3], velocity[0] being the 0th
Problem 3
had to look up the shape function
for array x it's x.shape
Problem 4
made a new notebook called my_functions
made a separate folder in my notebooks folder called functions
made the function ft_to_m_cm, downloaded it as ft_to_m_hw5.py
made a separate foler for homework in my notebooks folder
Problem 5
made displacement_hw5 file with my displacement function
kept getting an error from using ^ instead of **
same error after changing operand
restarting jupyter fixed the error
Problem 6
copied notebook and function files into handin/hw5_JacobMorrissey
committed changes on github desktop with the message 'HW6' and pushed
took a screenshot of the commit on github and moved it to hw5_JacobMorrissey
will add my log file, zip the folder and submit to webcourses

Problem 1
made folders in my handin, homework, and notebook folders each called Midterm
made a new notebook called midterm_jacobmorrissey
Problem 2
started by making a list of cities
made variables start_city and target_city empty strings
used a while loop to ask for input
if the input city is not in the list, it asks again, otherwise it replaces the empty string
Problem 3
used np.loadtxt to get data from distances_midterm.dat and skipped the first row
used city_list.index to get the index of the start and target cities
made a function travel_distance_and_time and saved as a .py file

*****OUT: Thu Sep 23 19:34:48 EDT 2021

*****IN: Thu Sep 23 23:41:34 EDT 2021

midterm problem 4
made a third while loop for the pitstop city
used np.ceil to round up the number of gas station stops
used "{0:.2f}"/format(cost) to print the cost to 2 decimal places
saved the function as midterm_problem4_function
went back and redid problems 3 and 4 by moving the input section of code into the functions travel_distance_and_time and trip
now in the notebook i simply call either function with no argument
problem 5
made a new function file midterm_pronlem5_function
used for i in range(len(city_list)) to scan through the list
to minimize the total distance i made a list distances and populated it with each value of start to i plus i to target
if i is the same as either the start or taget city it sets the distance equal to 50000 to ensure it won't be the minimum value
went back and took the screenshot needed for problem 2 named midterm_JaMor_prob2_test
added the screenshot, main notebook, functions notebook, function .py files, and log to handin folder
sent to a compressed folder
commited changes to github and pushed
will wait to submit to webcourses in case i need to make changes

HW6 problem 1
made hw6_JacobMorrissey folder in handin folder
started a new notebook hw6_JacobMorrissey.ipynb
problem 2
imported numpy and matplotlib.pyplot
saved plot as hw6_jamor_prob2_plot
problem 3
had trouble using np.where
to get just the indices from the output of np.where i called np.where(q>50)[0]
this gave me the indices as an array instead of an array inside a tuple
problem 4
made a new function quadratic in quadratic_hw6.py
ran into a problem when using b^2 in my function
the ^ operator returned a float which caused significant rounding error
using b*b instead fixed the problem
problem 5
copied notebook, function, plot, and log to hw6_jacobmorrissey folder
committed changes and pushed to github
took a screenshot of the commit on github and added to handin folder
sent the folder to a compressed folder

hw7
problem 1
made handin folder hw7_JacobMorrissey
started new notebook hw7_JacobMorrissey
problem 2
didn't want to type out the full dictionary so i made a list of the words and populated the dict with a for loop
problem 3
couldn't think of a different way to use a while loop so i basically turned it into a for loop by incrementing a variable j
problem 4
used x % 2 to determine if a value is even or odd
problem 5
made the function to calculate all of the grades before realizing it should only return one student's
function still calculates all of the grades but takes an input to chose which student's grade it outputs
Problem 6
added everything to the hw7_JacobMorrissey handin folder
pushed to github
took screenshot
sent handin folder to compressed folder and submitted to webcourses

hw8
problem 1
made handin folder and started new notebook for hw 8
problem 2
only calculating the ellipse from the x values caused gaps in the ellipse
doing 2 calculations from x and y and plotting them on top of each other gives one solid ellipse
the axes made automatically by matplot are scaled such that each ellipse looks like a circle
setting limits of both axes equal made the shape of the ellipse visible
problem 3
read the input array into a list so i can append and remove elements easier
used a for loop to find the minimum value of the list
nested the for loop in a while loop to remove the min and append to a new list until it is the same length as the input array
returned the sorted list as an array using np.asarray
checking with np.sort gives the same result
problem 4
using units of years and AU reduces kepler's law to P^2 = a^3
kepler_3rd function only needs to do one operation a = P ** (2/3)
had to change the position of the x ticks and rotate so the planet names were readable
problem 5
added everything to handin folder
sent handin folder to compressed folder
commited changes made for hw8 to github and pushed
turned in zip file to webcourses.

HW9
problem 1
made handin folder
problem 2
this problem seems much easier using arrays
having trouble getting the corresponding name after finding the max / min time
read the keys of both dictionaries into separate lists
after finding the index of max/min time i can just get the name with the same index in the list
problem 3
chose a problem from my analytical chemistry lab
i need to find the endpoint of a titration by taking the derivative of the titration curve
got an approximate derivative using np.ediff1d which takes the difference of consecutive elements in an array
problem 4
not sure when to use self and when to use a different variable
changed self to box in all of the functions except init
remember to call a function with object.function() NOT function(object)
starting to figure out how to use booleans
made a kind of modular sentence for the print_gift function with booleans.
problem 5
copying hw9 notebook and log into hw9 handin folder
sending handin folder to zip folder from file explorer and submitting to webcourses
committing and pushing changes to github

hw 10
problem 1
made handin folder and new notebook
problem 2
copied and pasted from last weeks homework:
       not sure when to use self and when to use a different variable
       changed self to box in all of the functions except init
       remember to call a function with object.function() NOT function(object)
       starting to figure out how to use booleans
       made a kind of modular sentence for the print_gift function with booleans.
problem 3
made a new N x 3 array triples and populated with P V and T for each given V
problem 4
np.where can only handle one condition at a time
x[ (x > 20) & (x < 40) ] works
problem says to scan through the array for part b so i looped over np.where(z>0)
having trouble with second part of part e
because there are 16 elements where -0.16<z<0 and 17 where 0<y<0.2 it's causing an indexing error
seems like it's trying to print 16 or 17 elements instead of the 16 x 17 array i want
to slice both dimensions with different conditions i needed to use:
data[ (z < 0) & (z > -0.16), :][:, (y > 0) & (y < 0.2)]
this slices the y dimension first then slices the x dimension of the resulting array
problem 5
wasn't sure how to use the github team thing so i made a new team team 2 (?)
didn't seem like anyone had made a team yet
made a new branch for my code
made a pull request and took a screenshot
problem 6
moved notebook, plot png, and github screenshot to handin folder
sent to zip file
commited and pushed changes to github

hw11
problem 1
made handin folder hw11_JacobMorrissey

problem 2
used same x values from data to calculate y values for the line
made a 2D array with the relative difference in y values for each value of a and b
found minimum value and a and b valuess with corresponding indices
this method won't find the absolute best fit but will find the best fit to a certain level of accuracy

problem 3
a) just copied the formula from the problem

b) looped over keys of input dictionary and populated a new dict with the same keys and with values 1 divided by the input values

c) checks whether the first element of a list is a string, if so uses that list as keys and the other list for values

d) for some reason np.shape only returns one value if the array has only one row
have to check both arrays then make new variables to represent the shapes of the arrays
also having trouble slicing when one of the arrays is 1 row
need to add another if statement
would have been a lot simpler if numpy didn't treat single row arrays so differently

problem 4
sent handin folder to zip file
committed and pushed changes to github
submitted to webcourses
