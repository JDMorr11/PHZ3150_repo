HW 2

*****In: Wed Sep 1 21:32:00 EST 2021
            
Made directory for Homework 2 under: Users/gabri/PHZ3150/handin/HW2_GabrielCardona-Tous
            
1a) Downloaded the 20.04.3 LTS Ubuntu application from the Windows app store on the laptop into: Windows subsystem for Linux
    
I updated and upgraded the software using the sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade commands in Ubuntu.

I installed Miniconda Python37 64-bit using URL: https://conda.io/miniconda.html to Users/gabri
        
I installed the additional packages numpy, scipy, 7.26.0 ipython, and matlolib with the following respective 
commands in the anaconda prompt: conda install (numpy, scipy, ipython, and matlolib) individually in that order
    
Following those installations, I used conda install to install the Jupyter notebook files into Users/gabri/miniconda3/scripts

I downloaded Emacs for Windows (macs-25.31-x8664.zip) using the URL: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-25/
        

I opened a BASH terminal and used the command sudo apt install git to install the git for the shell
Then, I proceeded to use the URL:https://git-scm.com/download/win to download the
64-bit Git for Windows Setup with the basic settings

I used command python3 to find the version of python, I got: Python 3.8.10
    
I used the snip tool to take a screenshot of the Jupyter notebook and uploaded it to Users/gabri/PHZ3150/handin/HW2_GabrielCardona-Tous
    
    
1b) I used the snip tool to take a screenshot of the Github desktop that I had already synced with phz3150/phz3150_main_dir
and uploaded it to Users/gabri/PHZ3150/handin/HW2_GabrielCardona-Tous

2) English sentence that has correct syntax but incorrectt tokens: H3llo every0ne, I 4m G4bri3l
   English sentence that has incorrect syntax and correct tokens: I are bad inside coding
    
What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages, and why?
There are various reasons that natural human lanugages could not go far as programming languages. I think that
the first reason would be because the computers work by the very strict rules that we have to put on them so that
they know exactly what to do. In addition, English sentences can be vague because they are meant to understand the
scenario, and the happenstance; however, in programming languages you would have to give every single variable and how
they exactly behave during the entire scenario, which could not be done in English, or would simply just be a too hard
and/or tedious process.

3) I used the URL: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world and completed the tutorial.
