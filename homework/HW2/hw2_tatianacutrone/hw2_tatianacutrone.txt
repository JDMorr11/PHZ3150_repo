English sentence with incorrect tokens: I cooked $paghetti for dinner.

This sentence is incorrect because the '$' used instead of 'S' cannot be processed in the word Spaghetti by a computer because the word doesn't exist in the natural language but a human that isn't limited to a programmed language can read it.

English sentence with incorrect syntax: I walked my dog with my mom.

This sentence is incorrect because a computer would read it as if you are walking your dog and your mom because a comma is missing but a human can logically put the sentence together that you are walking the dog with your mother without needing a comma in place.

After GitHub Hello World tutorial completed through link:
