downloaded HW4 file into homework folder
created hw4_jacobmorrissey folder in handin folder
opened new jupyter notebook hw4_jacobmorrissey.ipynb
began problem 2
tried to use a for loop to calculate F from lists of m and a values
      for i in m:
      	  F = m[i] * a[i]
	  print(F)
got an error because i is equal to the element in the list and not its index
searched for a guide on for loops and found a different method
      for i in range(len(m)):
      	  F = m[i] * a[i]
	  print(F)
this method worked
used the same structure to define a function force_to_acceleration
     Caclulates acceleration a [m / s^2] of a 150 kg body from the applied force F [kg m / s^2].
began problem 3
wrote all four variables from the hw file as lists
created a file for the acceleration function: accleration_hw4.py
imported the function in my hw4 notebook
used the same for loop structure again to calculate a

changed the file names of the screenshots taken for hw2
each file name now starts with hw2_JaMor_prob#_ followed by the application name
previously these file names didn't include the hhw number, my name, or problem number
copied my hw4 notebook and acceleration function into my handin folder
changes to the handin folder weren't being tracked
couldn't get any changes to track so i made a new repository
moved my entire class folder into PHZ3150_repo
made a new hw4_jacobmorrissey folder and added my jupyter files
committed the changes and pushed
will save my log and add to hw4_jacobmorrissey then zip and submit to webcourses

HW5
Problem 1
made folder hw5_jacobmorrissey in handin folder
opened jupyter notebook
created new notebook called hw5_jacobmorrissey
Problem 2
made lists using list(range(0,100,10)) and 1000,100
assumed the 3rd element refers to velocity[3], velocity[0] being the 0th
Problem 3
had to look up the shape function
for array x it's x.shape
Problem 4
made a new notebook called my_functions
made a separate folder in my notebooks folder called functions
made the function ft_to_m_cm, downloaded it as ft_to_m_hw5.py
made a separate foler for homework in my notebooks folder
Problem 5
made displacement_hw5 file with my displacement function
kept getting an error from using ^ instead of **
same error after changing operand
restarting jupyter fixed the error
Problem 6
copied notebook and function files into handin/hw5_JacobMorrissey
committed changes on github desktop with the message 'HW6' and pushed
took a screenshot of the commit on github and moved it to hw5_JacobMorrissey
will add my log file, zip the folder and submit to webcourses

Problem 1
made folders in my handin, homework, and notebook folders each called Midterm
made a new notebook called midterm_jacobmorrissey
Problem 2
started by making a list of cities
made variables start_city and target_city empty strings
used a while loop to ask for input
if the input city is not in the list, it asks again, otherwise it replaces the empty string
Problem 3
used np.loadtxt to get data from distances_midterm.dat and skipped the first row
used city_list.index to get the index of the start and target cities
made a function travel_distance_and_time and saved as a .py file

*****IN: Thu Sep 23 23:41:34 EDT 2021

midterm problem 4
made a third while loop for the pitstop city
used np.ceil to round up the number of gas station stops
used "{0:.2f}"/format(cost) to print the cost to 2 decimal places
saved the function as midterm_problem4_function
went back and redid problems 3 and 4 by moving the input section of code into the functions travel_distance_and_time and trip
now in the notebook i simply call either function with no argument
problem 5
made a new function file midterm_pronlem5_function
used for i in range(len(city_list)) to scan through the list
to minimize the total distance i made a list distances and populated it with each value of start to i plus i to target
if i is the same as either the start or taget city it sets the distance equal to 50000 to ensure it won't be the minimum value
went back and took the screenshot needed for problem 2 named midterm_JaMor_prob2_test
added the screenshot, main notebook, functions notebook, function .py files, and log to handin folder
sent to a compressed folder
commited changes to github and pushed
will wait to submit to webcourses in case i need to make changes

HW6 problem 1
made hw6_JacobMorrissey folder in handin folder
started a new notebook hw6_JacobMorrissey.ipynb
problem 2
imported numpy and matplotlib.pyplot
saved plot as hw6_jamor_prob2_plot
problem 3
had trouble using np.where
to get just the indices from the output of np.where i called np.where(q>50)[0]
this gave me the indices as an array instead of an array inside a tuple
problem 4
made a new function quadratic in quadratic_hw6.py
ran into a problem when using b^2 in my function
the ^ operator returned a float which caused significant rounding error
using b*b instead fixed the problem
problem 5
copied notebook, function, plot, and log to hw6_jacobmorrissey folder
committed changes and pushed to github
took a screenshot of the commit on github and added to handin folder
sent the folder to a compressed folder
