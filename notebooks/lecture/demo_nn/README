This demo on neural networks (NNs) consists of 2 cases:
- NN-circle  : Using an NN to model a unit circle
- NN-gaussian: Using an NN to model a Gaussian

They are both located in the demoNN.ipynb Jupyter notebook.  
The plots and weights subdirectories contain the output for the models.

Note that the notebook is set to use already-trained models;
if you would like to train new models, override the `load` parameter to False
for calls to TrainModel().

In this top-level directory, there is the associated environment.yml file.
This can be used to create the Conda environment necessary to run the code.
To create the environment, input the command
    conda env create -f environment.yml
into the terminal. This will create the demoNN environment.  Activate it via 
    conda activate demoNN
